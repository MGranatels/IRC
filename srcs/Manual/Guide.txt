An IRC server implementation in C++ - There are several open-source IRC server implementations available that you can use as a reference. 
An example is ircd-hybrid, an IRC server implementation written in C++ that is widely used in the IRC community.

IRC developer communities - Joining IRC developer communities, such as the #ircdev channel on Freenode, 
can be helpful in getting support and advice from experienced IRC developers.
