4.4 Sending messages

   The main purpose of the IRC protocol is to provide a base for clients
   to communicate with each other.  PRIVMSG and NOTICE are the only
   messages available which actually perform delivery of a text message
   from one client to another - the rest just make it possible and try
   to ensure it happens in a reliable and structured manner.

4.4.1 Private messages

      Command: PRIVMSG
   Parameters: <receiver>{,<receiver>} <text to be sent>

   PRIVMSG is used to send private messages between users.  <receiver>
   is the nickname of the receiver of the message.  <receiver> can also
   be a list of names or channels separated with commas.

   The <receiver> parameter may also me a host mask  (#mask)  or  server
   mask  ($mask).   In  both cases the server will only send the PRIVMSG
   to those who have a server or host matching the mask.  The mask  must
   have at  least  1  (one)  "."  in it and no wildcards following the
   last ".".  This requirement exists to prevent people sending messages
   to  "#*"  or "$*",  which  would  broadcast  to  all  users; from
   experience, this is abused more than used responsibly and properly.
   Wildcards are  the  '*' and  '?'   characters.   This  extension  to
   the PRIVMSG command is only available to Operators.

   Numeric Replies:

           ERR_NORECIPIENT                 ERR_NOTEXTTOSEND
           ERR_CANNOTSENDTOCHAN            ERR_NOTOPLEVEL
           ERR_WILDTOPLEVEL                ERR_TOOMANYTARGETS
           ERR_NOSUCHNICK
           RPL_AWAY

   Examples:

:Angel PRIVMSG Wiz :Hello are you receiving this message ?
                                ; Message from Angel to Wiz.

PRIVMSG Angel :yes I'm receiving it !receiving it !'u>(768u+1n) .br ;
                                Message to Angel.

PRIVMSG jto@tolsun.oulu.fi :Hello !
                                ; Message to a client on server

                                tolsun.oulu.fi with username of "jto".

PRIVMSG $*.fi :Server tolsun.oulu.fi rebooting.
                                ; Message to everyone on a server which
                                has a name matching *.fi.

PRIVMSG #*.edu :NSFNet is undergoing work, expect interruptions
                                ; Message to all users who come from a
                                host which has a name matching *.edu.

4.4.2 Notice

      Command: NOTICE
   Parameters: <nickname> <text>

   The NOTICE message is used similarly to PRIVMSG.  The difference
   between NOTICE and PRIVMSG is that automatic replies must never be
   sent in response to a NOTICE message.  This rule applies to servers
   too - they must not send any error reply back to the client on
   receipt of a notice.  The object of this rule is to avoid loops
   between a client automatically sending something in response to
   something it received.  This is typically used by automatons (clients
   with either an AI or other interactive program controlling their
   actions) which are always seen to be replying lest they end up in a
   loop with another automaton.

   See PRIVMSG for more details on replies and examples.
