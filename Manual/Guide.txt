a) Check Number of Arguments can only receive two, a Port and A password (password bot Yet defined)

b) Build Server object you can pass any port within the limits. I have been using 6667
	i) Calls the function Init which will do the primary set ups of the server

c) StartConection and open sockets, this is made by 4 steps:
	1. Set Server Info => setServerInfo() function to do that
	2. Bind the socket to the server => bindSocketFD() for that
	3. After binding and getting server dada we start connection (StartConection() for that in main)
	4. Listen which will wait for clients to connect to the channel => In order to optimize this we use it combined with Select()

d) Connection is set and now we handle it with HandleConnection(), which will do the following actions in its compossition:
	i) Checks if any user as connected to the server and reports back
	ii ) Checks if any user sent a message with the recev() function
	iii) Keeps user data which we need to understand how to extrapulate that and create clients from There
	iV) Checks if any user disconected from the server

e) To run the program and test it without the UGI its pretty simple, just follow the following steps:
	1. Open two terminals side by side
	2. In the first terminal run the program with 
		i) port: 6667 (or one of your choice as long as its valid) 
		ii) password: not relevant for now just insert any thing you want.
	3. In second terminal run the following: nc 127.0.0.1 6667 
	4. Type a message on terminal 2

	Congratz!! you just did your first IRC connection and trasmited information trough a TPC protocol :D
